Title:
Stock Market Sentiment Predictor

Abstract:
In this project, we aim to produce a tool that will be able to predict the stock movement of a company. The output will be a binary output where
it will indicated whether we are bullish or bearish on a stock. In our pursuit of making this tool, we will incorporate graph convolutional networks
to take advantage of the interconnected features of stocks.
